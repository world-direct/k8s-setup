  Helm v3 chart for deployment of flannel to wd clusters
  Taken from version https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/2140ac876ef134e0ed5af15c65e414cf26827915/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml

# This is from master, as release v0.11.0 is very old, and still uses apiVersion "extensions/v1beta1"

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
version: 0.0.2

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application.
appVersion: 0.0.3-2140ac8

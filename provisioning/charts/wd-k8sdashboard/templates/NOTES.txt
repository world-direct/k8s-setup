# About this chart

This was created by the {{ .Chart.AppVersion }} of the https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard repository.

Original Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0-beta5/aio/deploy/alternative.yaml

Performed the following modifications:
1. Replaced 'namespace: kubernetes-dashboard' with 'namespace={{"{{"}} .Release.Namespace }}'
2. Removed the creation of the namespace, as this happens before
3. Splitted the files for better navigation

Because we will provide ssl termination (and OIDC) in the proxy on the ingress, 
the dashboard service is configured unsecure. So we can use the "Alternative Setup"
